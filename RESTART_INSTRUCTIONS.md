# 🚨 URGENT: RESTART STREAMLIT NOW

## The feature IS implemented in the code, but you MUST restart Streamlit!

### Steps:
1. **Go to your terminal where Streamlit is running**
2. **Press `Ctrl + C`** to stop the server
3. **Run this command again:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
4. **Refresh your browser**

### You will see:
- A **RED BANNER** saying "UPDATE 2.1: PASSIVE SENTINEL ACTIVE"
- A navigation button called **"🔔 SENTINEL"**

### The code is 100% there:
- ✅ `modules/passive_sentinel.py` exists
- ✅ Import added to `app.py` (line 12)
- ✅ Navigation updated (line 507)
- ✅ Routing logic added (line 1465)

**RESTART THE SERVER NOW!**
